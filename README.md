# Shooter Game

Iâ€™m really proud of this game! I love how it turned out.

The main objective is to **survive as a rocket in space**. You win when you **shoot 10 aliens**, but you lose if:

* You get **hit by an alien** or a **meteorite**, or
* You **miss 3 aliens** (they travel across the screen without being hit).

## Features

* Dynamic collision detection and response
* Score and life tracking system
* Game-over and victory states with clear feedback
