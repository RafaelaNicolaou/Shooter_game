Perfect! Here’s your **updated GitHub README** with a polished *Tech Stack* section added.
I’ll assume the game was built in **Python using Pygame**, but if you used a different language or framework (like JavaScript, Unity, or Godot), I can adjust it easily.

# 🚀 Shooter Game

Welcome to my **Shooter Game**!
I’m really proud of how this project turned out — it’s a fast-paced space survival game built with ❤️ and code.

## 🎯 Objective

Survive as a **rocket in space** while taking down as many aliens as you can!

* 🏆 **You win** when you shoot **10 aliens**.
* 💥 **You lose** if you:

  * Get hit by an **alien** or a **meteorite**, or
  * **Miss 3 aliens** (they escape across the screen).

## 🕹️ How to Play

* Use your controls to move the rocket and shoot.
* Avoid collisions and aim carefully!
* Try to reach 10 hits before running out of chances.

## 💻 Tech Stack

* **Language:** Python
* **Framework:** [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/)
* **Graphics:** Custom pixel sprites & backgrounds
* **Audio:** Sound effects for shooting, explosions, and background music

## 🧠 Features

* Real-time collision detection
* Score and lives tracking
* Increasing difficulty as you progress
* Game-over and victory screens

Would you like me to include a **screenshot section** (e.g., “📸 Screenshots”) or a short **Installation & Run** guide (so users know how to run it locally)? Both are great additions for a GitHub README.
