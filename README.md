#Shooter Game

I’m really proud of this game! I love how it turned out.

The main objective is to **survive as a rocket in space**. You win when you **shoot 10 aliens**, but you lose if:

* You get **hit by an alien** or a **meteorite**, or
* You **miss 3 aliens** (they travel across the screen without being hit).

## Features

* Dynamic collision detection and response
* Score and life tracking system
* Gradually increasing difficulty
* Game-over and victory states with clear feedback

## Installation & Execution

To run the game locally:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/RafaelaNicolaou/Shooter-Game.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd Shooter-Game

# Install dependencies
pip install pygame

# Run the game
python main.py
```

Would you like me to make a **short version** for the top of your GitHub page (like a 2–3 line project summary that appears before the table of contents)? That’s usually what visitors see first and helps them quickly understand what the project is about.
